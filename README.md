# 42_Get_next_line
Another basic C funciton to read a file line by line.

This is the 2019 version of the Get next line function of 42 school.
Since it's made with the bonuses in mind, it's capable of keep track of the reading of many files at the same time.
I included a text file for testing proposes.
